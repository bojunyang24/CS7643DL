Consider a (not necessarily convex) differentiable function $g : \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. $g$ has a local minimum at some $\mathbf{w}^{t}$ if there exists some $\gamma > 0$ such that for all $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$, $\norm{\mathbf{w}^{t} - \mathbf{w}}_{2} < \gamma \Rightarrow g(\mathbf{w}^{t}) \leq g(\mathbf{w})$.

Prove that if $g$ has a local minimum at some $\mathbf{w}^{t}$ then the gradient at $\mathbf{w}^{t} = 0$, and that the converse
is not necessarily true.
