Consider the XOR function
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} 
\hline
$x_1$ & $x_2$ & $f_{\texttt{XOR}}(x)$ \\ 
\hline
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 0 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Prove that XOR can NOT be represented using a linear model with the same form as \eqref{eq:linear_threshold}.

[\textit{Hint:} To see why, plot the examples from above in a plane and think about drawing a linear boundary that separates them.]
